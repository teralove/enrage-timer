# Enrage Timer
A modified version that displays a counter for enrage #'s. Useful for knowing when 3rd enrage is happening to cast Adrenaline Rush, Contagion, etc.

### Chat Commands
* !et - Toggles the module off/on
* !et.party - Toggles sending messages to party/yourself.

Commands are not case-sensitive, [slash](https://github.com/baldera-mods/slash) is supported but not required.

### Info
* Messages are sent to yourself only by default.
* I am not the original author of Enrage Timer. I simply modified it for personal preferences (Removed some text, less spam, added commands, and added enrage #'s).
